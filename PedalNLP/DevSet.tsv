where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading	<P> Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year . </P>

where are the hormones of the anterior pituitary created	<Dd> The pars distalis , ( distal part ) , comprises the majority of the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs . The pars distalis contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells . The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils ( alpha cells ) and basophils ( beta cells ) . These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary , and release them into the blood stream . </Dd>

where does cleavage of the peptide bond by chymotrypsin occur	<P> Chymotrypsin ( EC 3.4. 21.1 , chymotrypsins A and B , alpha - chymar ophth , avazyme , chymar , chymotest , enzeon , quimar , quimotrase , alpha - chymar , alpha - chymotrypsin A , alpha - chymotrypsin ) is a digestive enzyme component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum where it performs proteolysis , the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides . Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side - chain of the amino acid N - terminal to the scissile amide bond ( the P position ) is a large hydrophobic amino acid ( tyrosine , tryptophan , and phenylalanine ) . These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a ' hydrophobic pocket ' ( the S position ) of the enzyme . It is activated in the presence of trypsin . The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P sidechain and the enzyme S binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme . Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates , particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P position . </P> 
where are the cones in the eye located	<P> Cone cells , or cones , are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes ( e.g. the human eye ) . They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light , as opposed to rod cells , which work better in dim light . Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis , a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin , densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina . There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula . The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935 . Oyster 's textbook ( 1999 ) cites work by Curcio et al. ( 1990 ) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina . </P>
