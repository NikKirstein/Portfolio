where was the outlaw of josey wales filmed	<P> Principal photography began on October 6 , 1975 in Lake Powell . A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming . Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently . </P>

where does the highway of heroes start and end	<P> By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered `` Highway 401 '' : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario -- Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald -- Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque -- Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade - separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9 - km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway / Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto . On September 27 , 2013 , the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto , to coincide with the move of the coroner 's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner 's Complex at the Humber River Hospital . </P> 
where is the university of wisconsin madison located	<P> The University of Wisconsin -- Madison ( also known as University of Wisconsin , Wisconsin , UW , or regionally as UW -- Madison , or simply Madison ) is a public research university in Madison , Wisconsin , United States . Founded when Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848 , UW -- Madison is the official state university of Wisconsin , and the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System . It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state . It became a land - grant institution in 1866 . The 933 - acre ( 378 ha ) main campus includes four National Historic Landmarks . </P> 
where was the capital of the habsburg empire located	<P> The Habsburg Monarchy ( German : Habsburgermonarchie ) or Empire is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the junior Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg - Lorraine until 1918 . The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire , united only in the person of the monarch . The dynastic capital was Vienna , except from 1583 to 1611 , when it was moved to Prague . From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire , and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro - Hungarian Empire . </P> 
where does the big sur begin and end	<P> The region does not have specific boundaries , but is generally considered to include the 71 miles ( 114 km ) segment of California State Route 1 from Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands south to San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon and the entire Santa Lucia range between the rivers . The interior region is uninhabited , while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated with about 1,000 year - round residents and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among four small settlements . When the region was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 , it was the United States ' `` last frontier . '' The region remained one of the most isolated areas of California and the United States until , after 18 years of construction , the Carmel -- San Simeon Highway ( now signed as part of State Route 1 ) was completed in 1937 . The winding , narrow road , often cut into the face of seaside cliffs , dominates the visitor 's experience of Big Sur . The highway has been closed more than 55 times by slides , and in May 2017 , a 2 million cubic foot landslide blocked the highway at Mud Creek , north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo border , to just south of Gorda . The road is expected to be reopened in June 2018 . </P> 
where are the cardiac and vasomotor centers found	<P> The vasomotor center ( VMC ) is a portion of the medulla oblongata that , together with the cardiovascular center and respiratory center , regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes . Vasomotor center is a fairly archaic term since this function relies not on a single brain structure ( `` center '' ) but rather represents a presympathetic network of interacting neurons . Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors , it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels . This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation , especially in the brain .
