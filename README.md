# Portfolio for Nik Kirstein
This repository serves as a place to showcase and share projects that I, and group members have worked on.  Certain projects exist as proof of concepts, simple scripts, or finished products. Individual descriptions below.

#### Web Design Final Project
A pediatric website designed for the final project of a web design class.  Custom HTML, CSS, and minor JavaScript functionality.  A collaborative project between Nik Kirstein and Esme Middaugh.

#### Web Development Final Project
A duel project consisting of a movies and roles display page (HTML, PHP) and a quotations management and voting app. (HTML, CSS, PHP).  A joint project between Nik Kirstein and Esme Middaugh.

#### TOBI
Traffic Obfuscated Internet.  A proof of concept project involving the mitmproxy python framework.  The project currently intercepts and stores HTML headers and then injects them back into requests along with modifying JavaScript.  The JavaScript currently has placeholder values but successfully has fed fake fingerprinting values to browserleaks.  Possible future development.  A collaborative project between Nik Kirstein and Gabriel Lemon.

#### PedalNLP
Pedal is a question answering NLP pipeline for Google's natural question.  The project involved processing jsonlines files and using NLP and a grammar parser to form triples of questions answers.  The triples were then turned into a vector and compared to find the answer.  It's a long script.

#### DappTestFrontEnd
A hacky and ugly Ethereum front end Dapp that's somewhat functional that's filled with debugging.  A research project during a front end developer internship that managed to display recent Ethereum blockchain transactions on a web page.  Built upon existing contract frameworks and test files, all work is mostly in app.js and index.html

##### Minor Projects
A series of smaller side projects, data cleaning and processing scripts, and random code files.  Details within the folder.
