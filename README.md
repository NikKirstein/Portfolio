# Portfolio for Nik Kirstein
This repository serves as a place to showcase and share projects that I, and group members have worked on.  Certain projects exist as proof of concepts, simple scripts, or finished products. Individual descriptions below.

#### Web Design Final Project
A pediatric website designed for the final project of a web design class.  Custom HTML, CSS, and minor JavaScript functionality.  A collaborative project between Nik Kirstein and Esme Middaugh.

#### Web Development Final Project
A duel project consisting of a movies and roles display page (HTML, PHP) and a quotations management and voting app. (HTML, CSS, PHP).  A joint project between Nik Kirstein and Esme Middaugh.

#### TOBI
Traffic Obfuscated Internet.  A proof of concept project involving the mitmproxy python framework.  The project currently intercepts and stores HTML headers and then injects them back into requests along with modifying JavaScript.  The JavaScript currently has placeholder values but successfully has fed fake fingerprinting values to browserleaks.  Possible future development.  A collaborative project between Nik Kirstein and Gabriel Lemon.

#### PedalNLP
Pedal is a question answering NLP pipeline for Google's natural question.  The project involved processing jsonlines files and using NLP and a grammar parser to form triples of questions answers.  The triples were then turned into a vector and compared to find the answer.  It's a long script.

#### DappTestFrontEnd
A hacky and ugly Ethereum front end Dapp that's somewhat functional that's filled with debugging.  A research project during a front end developer internship that managed to display recent Ethereum blockchain transactions on a web page.  Built upon existing contract frameworks and test files, all work is mostly in app.js and index.html

#### ticket_sentinment_analysis
This project takes essentially what is help desk tickets for a video game that requires moderation, and filters and runs sentimental analysis on all admin ticket sends to players of the game.  Uses the nltk library and an Elasticsearch database of help desk tickets in order to function.  The list of admin names has been sanitizied for this example, this is just to show off the script, not really be ran since it requires the documents in Elastic to be in a specific format.

#### pyelastic
A project for connecting to an Elasticsearch instance with Python and doing a variety of functions from printing stats, exporting as CSV or writing to an index.  Also can modify documents if required.
This project was sanitized and requires a running Elasticsearch instance to work.  This is for display purposes.

#### screenshotter
A project originally written for a now retired video capture software called Morae.  Contains a variety of utilities in it like a file-renamer, video cropper, video screenshotter, and video length reporting script.
Filenames and paths and been sanitized, and may require a specific format to function. This is mostly for display purposes.

##### Minor Projects
A series of smaller side projects, data cleaning and processing scripts, and random code files.  Details within the folder.
