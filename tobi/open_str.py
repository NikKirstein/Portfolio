The goal of TOBI is to obfuscate one users http traffic with a
another's harvested http traffic. We pose our traffic as theirs.
Authors: Nik Kirstein, Gabe Lemon

The program might eventually expand to gather all kinds of traffic and then
using that gathered traffic that has been saved, hide all kinds of traffic
as another user's.  Basically, browsing the web and having all our traffic
look like it's someone else. This can be extended to be malicious and pose as stolen traffic.
It could also be expanded to be crowd soured traffic sharing and obfuscation.
