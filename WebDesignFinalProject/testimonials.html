	<h2>Read about some of our satisfied patients.  These are real testimonies from actual patients and parents!</h2>
	
	<div class='all_testimonials'>
	<p class='testimonials'>As parents of four children, my wife and I have always put the medical care of our children as top priority. Relocating to Tucson, AZ from the Boston, MA area meant leaving our wonderful pediatrician, trained at Boston Children's Hospital, behind. 
	
	<br />For the first three years in Tucson, AZ we had three different pediatric practices, none of which we felt gave our children satisfactory attention and care. On one Saturday we were waiting in the waiting room for 2 and 1/2 hours with our 3 year old who had been up all night suffering from an ear infection. A parent sitting next to us, feeling the same frustration, told us about a new paediatric practice, ISTA Pediatrics.
	
	<br />After meeting with Dr. Alpha and discussing concepts and philosophy in the care of our children, we felt strongly that our decision to put our children under his care was a good one. Dr. Alpha has been kind, gentle, caring and fully accessible at all times. Our children know and trust him. He has been spot on in many instances in diagnosing and treating our children on various ailments and injuries. We especially appreciate his home style approach and his caring demeanor. He has enlightened us in many ways of natural and holistic approaches we have implemented successfully in the everyday child care elements of our family. We don't know what we would do without him. </p>
	
	
	
	<p class='testimonialsalt'>Thank you for this opportunity to share our thoughts on the greatness of Dr. Alpha and ISTA Pediatrics.   
	Our family appreciates all of your newsletters! They are really wonderful for the parents of your little patients. I just overheard someone talking about your H1N1 vaccine newsletter at the girls&#8217; dance class. She was saying how great it was. It's amazing how many parents you've reached out to and given the knowledge to make their own decisions. It's really great!   </p>
	
	
	
	<p class='testimonials'>I thank you from the bottom of my heart for attending to Alexandra on Tuesday evening. When she woke with that familiar, yet horrifying bark of the croup virus, I felt a tremendous sense of relief knowing that we had you on our team. As you promised, you were a phone call away... and within minutes, you were at our doorstep.  </p> 
	
	
	
	<p class='testimonialsalt'>It&#8217;s been a little over four weeks since our baby girl had her first appointment with ISTA Pediatrics. And I am still wowed by the experience my family and I were exposed to. If you haven&#8217;t been told lately, I will take the time to tell you now... you are all marvelous at what you do as physicians!</p>
	
	
	
	<p class='testimonials'>It was so wonderful and comforting to have such a fine pediatrician for our first child. We sincerely appreciate your time, patience and warm hospitality during our visits to your office.  You always made us feel at ease, and everything you suggested in response to our concerns was very helpful! </p>
	

	
	<p class='testimonialsalt'>Almost three years ago, just before my daughter was born, I met Dr. Delta for the first time. As a first time mom, I had many questions and concerns (and still do, as she can attest!). From the very beginning she was thoughtful and caring and put my mind at ease about being a new mom.   </p>
