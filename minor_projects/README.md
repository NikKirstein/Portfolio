### Minor Projects
These are minor scripts of everything from unorganized text parsers, web scrapers, corpus text processors, and other various things.  See details below.

##### blackjack.py
A blackjack simulation game.  Made to also practice different betting simulations and strategies.

##### download_time.py
A simple script for inputting download internet speed and a file size and estimating the length of time to download the file.

##### FFLOC_SCRAPER.py
This is a beautiful soup web scraping script in python that scrapes data from this website: http://www.splloc.soton.ac.uk/tasklist/

##### FS_general_formatter.py
A data parsing script for the FFLOC and SPLLOC corpus data for usage in antconc tools.  Normalizes text and blocks off non-speaking text with omission characters.

##### flip.py
A coin flip simulation game.  Made to also practice different betting simulations and strategies.

##### Mass_directory_unzipper.py
A simple python script which goes through a directory of zip files, and makes another directory of the same structure with the unzipped files.

##### todopy
A personal hobby of mine. I have an affection for todo lists and slowly over time have played around with developing some python command line todo list scripts.  You can see my progression from early days of knowing python to later. Hopefully I can add a GUI one day.

##### russianscriptV2.py
A dirty and function lacking python script used for processing the NN(Ch).xls file.  Written in the early introduction of learning python.  Used for gathering all words and counting occurrences and locations of word in files.  Written before learning NLTK.

##### wordle_helper_main.py
A script I wrote to help cheat at wordle, just to see how well I could write something to help me solve wordles.  I saw lots of different solvers online and took my own shot at it.  This script reads and requires the answers.txt file of leaked wordle answers. Based on you inputting your guesses of known letters, known letter positions, and known non-letters, it will present you with all possible answers left that fit the criteria.
